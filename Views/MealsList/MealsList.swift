 The `MealsList` struct represents a list view displaying a list of meals.
 
 It presents a list of meals fetched from the `MealsViewModel`. Each meal is displayed as a navigation link to the corresponding meal detail view (`MealDetailView`). The appearance and content of the list are determined by the data provided by the view model.
